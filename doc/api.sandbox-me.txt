This document provides a short draft of /proc/sandboxer/sandbox-me file.


Writing
=======
Sandboxer supports writing onlu one byte '1' (ASCII 49) to this file. This
action means that from now and until process's death this process will be
sandboxed by its parent. Attempts to write any other information will receive
-EBADRQC as the result of SYS_write system call.

Reading
=======
Any process can always read information about its slot id from this file. If
process is not sandboxed, 0 will be read from that file.
